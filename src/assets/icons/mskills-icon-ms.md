Use case: logo-brand. Design ONE original production app-icon master for MSkills, a desktop skill library that organizes, edits and reuses AI-agent skill modules. Design concept: 'Modular S'. The entire square canvas is a perfectly uniform deep petrol-teal background (#103E45), edge to edge, no transparency and no rounded outer frame, suitable as an unmasked app icon background layer. Center ONE large, extremely clear pale ice-white (#EAF8F2) geometric emblem occupying about 56 percent of the canvas width and height. The emblem is a distinctive compact S-shaped system mark, constructed from three broad stepped module segments with two consistent wide negative-space channels: a confident top horizontal module, a smooth diagonal central connector, and an opposing bottom horizontal module. The integrated silhouette reads as a single abstract S and an orderly stack of reusable modules, not a typed font character. Use generous stroke thickness, exact geometric alignment, modestly softened corners, purposeful cutouts, and excellent optical centering. Flat frontal graphic artwork with a very subtle tonal distinction between the modules at most, no illustrated objects. Designed to stay memorable at 24 to 32 pixels and to work in monochrome. Contemporary AI productivity identity based on shape clarity, a limited distinctive palette and consistent scale; completely original symbol, do not copy any existing brand logo. Restrained, precise, calm, visually polished. No text, no app name, no letter M, no star or sparkle, no knot or flower, no brain or robot, no app screenshot, no cards or folder illustration, no gradients or decorative glow, no shiny plastic, no metallic bevel, no grain, no border, no shadows, no presentation sheet and no multiple variants. Crisp clean edges. Square final asset.

Use case: logo-brand. Refine this MSkills app icon so its central emblem clearly contains BOTH Latin capital letters M and S. Exact visible text: "MS". Preserve the existing full-bleed deep petrol-teal background and pale ice-white foreground palette, restrained frontal flat graphic finish, and perfectly square canvas. Replace the existing standalone S emblem with ONE carefully crafted MS monogram. The M is clearly identifiable on the LEFT and the S clearly identifiable on the RIGHT, on the same optical baseline, tightly composed as a single memorable mark while both letters remain readable. Build the letters from the same broad modular geometry: a bold geometric M with purposeful diagonal inner cuts, and an S formed by three controlled stepped modules and generous negative-space channels. Consistent stroke weight, modestly softened corners, clean geometric cuts, excellent optical spacing. Both letters must read unmistakably as M and S, even at small app-icon sizes; do not fuse them into an ambiguous abstract symbol. The combined monogram occupies about 65 percent of canvas width and 40 to 45 percent of height, centered with calm generous margins. Custom logo lettering rather than ordinary typed text. No other letters or words, no app-name caption, no decorative star, sparkle, AI brain, cube, knot, cards, chrome, glow, thick bevel, texture, border, drop shadow or mockup. A refined contemporary productivity-app identity emphasizing modular skill management. Keep background opaque and edge to edge, with no outside transparency.
